how is it going wayne
i'm not too bad
thank you very much for coming out today
how w's business lately
it's been good
we recently commissioned a new facility so i've been busy managing that
i read about that on your company website
congratulations
thank you
the japanese market has been very interested in our product
so having this new facility should satisfy their demand for the next couple of years
the japanese market is turnning upwards lately
i was in japan last month and talked to a couple of potential customers
they all told me that they are looking for a reliable and consistent supply
well we are well positioned then
we have six facilities with over one million ton capacity
you also operate your own terminal
yes so we can control the ship loading and schedule
having control wover the supply chain is definitely helpful
being flexible is really important
how as the korean market ben lately
i hear that they aren't looking for longtern contracts
is that true
yes it is
they are mainly looking for spot contract
why is that
well they don't want to overcommit to one supplier
so they prefer a source from various suppliers
is that tou also keep the prize down
they can compare prices and shop around for the cheapest price
sounds like a lot of work
we could offer them a ten year contract and they can sit back and relax
yeah that would make life easier
we should keep an eye on that market
yeah there is a lot of changes happening lately
we should catch up again in a couple of months
that would be good
great
thank you for your time today
thank you as well
hi there
i'm rian from company a
hi i'm john from company b
how did you like the seminar just now
it was okay
they weren't talking about anything new
is this your first time at the expo
yes it is
that figures
what do you mean
they recycle their presentation so the content is basically the same every year
is that allowed
well people here don't come for the seminar
they come to network with people
and enjoy time out of the office
i see
i will keep that in mind for next time then
so tell me a bit about what you do
well we are a training company and mainly do exports
oh we do exports as well
we are in a sense competitors then
i guess so
but depending on the situation we could cooperate to share the risk
good point
here's my card
let me know if you ever want to discuss any potential partnerships
thank you
ben did you hear about company a's facility
what happened
there was a fire and they had to evacuate everyone there
did the building burn down
i think so
do you think this will affect the market
well company a had recently cut back on their production
they say it was due to the lack of raw material
so my answer is no it won't affect the market
do you think they will go bankrupt
maybe
but this isn't the first time their facility burned down
what do you mean
well they have a facility elsewhere before and that burn down
then a couple years later a new facility elsewhere magically burned down as well
some say it was intentional
so they can claim insurance
who knows
but their reputation isn't that good in the industry
so you can't help but think maybe it was intentional
wow
if it was intentional i hope they don't get away with it
well it's not up to us to decide
time to get back to work now
hi this is sam from the seattle office
oh hi sam
i haven't heard from you in a while
yeah there hasn't been much projects going on
well i assume you're starting to get busy since you're calling me
that's right
i wanted to ask you to draft a sales contract today
it's a short term sales contract with company a
can you tell me a bit more about the contract
iy we're looking to have the contract for a term of two years
we will be selling automotive parts to them
what's the volume like
it'll be twelve thousand tons per year
so one thousand tons per month
yes it will be shipped monthly
oky i'll make a standard stales contract based on what i know now
yes that would be great
i can also send you a summary of our business relations and other details
that would be very helpful
once i get your draft i'll send it to company a and get their feed back
yes let me know what they say and i'll see if their changes are acceptable or not
thank you very much
anything else you need
no think i'm good
alright have a good one then
bye now
alright here's some company orientation materials
thank you
you can read those later
i'd like to first explain what our department does
as you know we are a japanese trading company
so we do a lot of commodity trading in various industries
but regardless of the product traded the procedures wer exporting or importing origintally the same
some products have specific requirements like permits or certificates right
that's right
your tasks will mainly be preparing export documents for products from north america going to asia
elaine and our department will teach you how it's done later
do you have any questions so far
i am okay for now
feel free to ask questions
you might not know what questions to ask now but that's completely normal
thank you
so we have <unk><unk> people in a office including you
currently have <unk> staff in our department
<unk> including you
i'll show you to your desk in a bit
you can let me know if you need anything for your table
anything
like an additional moditor desk trade things like that
oh okay
i'll explain a bit about our other departments now
you also have a mining department an they have <unk> staff there
their main operation is managing mine assets in north america
our admint department has <unk> staff and they handled everything from hr accounting an any office administration
how about we show you your desk now
that sounds good
come in
you wanted to talk with me mr ko
yes so here take this business card
i know you are still new but since you don't have many leads you should contact him
um thank you mr ko
may i ask who he is and what his relationship is with this company
i never met him
just call him and see what you can do
excuse me
but how am i even going to proceed
i need to know what type of product he is interested in or what brought his business card to our company in order to make the contact more relayable
i think you should be more openminded and take whatever work you can
you shouldn't be looking to pick things you want to do
excuse me i think you misunderstood me
i just don't want to be inefficient here
i also don't want him to feel like this is a cold call
just tell him you got the card from me
but you just said you never met him
yumi i think you should be focusing on working harder and not complaining about what information you do or do not have
but mr ko
dismissed
is this how i am supposed to work
i mean if i just made a silly cold call and babbled about mr ko having his business card wondering how it got there doesn't that reflect badly on this company
so you need to understand that mr ko has zero sales experience
that is not what he said
trust me if he ever had any meaningful experience he would not just throw a business card at you
he has no clue how information regarding leat should be relayed
can you show me the business card
okay so this company is relatively big so john should know about it
i do small cap he does large multinationals
alright so i get some background info from john and
just talk to him you will walk you through the process
just make sure you never go to mr ko again
oh please it's not even funny
he was so condescending like weare in school and he's the head master or something
sorry i left but he doesn't really do anything to contribute other than make plsheets rearrange where everyone is sitting ind control the thermostaff
i think i figured it out
okay so what was it
so china has a value added tax applied to all exports
however some products are eligible for a tax redemption
what's the rate for the value added tax
it's <unk><unk> percent
what's the story with wood products then
apparently back in twothou<unk><unk> hree wood products were eligible for a tax redemption
but the chinese government abolished that so the value added tax applies to all primary wood products
what's the definition of primary wood products
things like lumber and logs
but products that are further processed like plywood or wooden furniture would be eligible for the tax redemption
oky that makes sense
thank you for looking this up
yeah i just happened to find it on a report issued by company a
i also sent an email to our trade compliance department but i think they will get back to us with the same answer
i'll wait for their confirmation before sending this report to the tokyo officei
did they say when they will get back to you
they said early next week
they will actually be getting in touch with our shanghai office to review this
oh okay
let me know when they get back to you then
will do
ms paste can i talk to you for a second
sure what's going on
do you remember product e has been on backorder
yes i remember that
i was just informed it is discontinued
i thought we are getting it restocked by the end of next month
how did you find out about it
we have <unk><unk> backorders for this product
i have been receiving many inquiries from the customers lately
they all want to know when it'll be restocked don't they
yes those customers are getting impatient
so i called the manufacturer to see what was going on
that's when i found out about the discontinuation of the product
elh no we olgain have some angry customers
have you already recontacted any of them regarding this issue
not yet i wanted to let you know first
you will have to issue a full refund to every single one of them immediately
make sure to explain about the situation
do you think that is going to satisfy the customers
those people have been patiently waiting for months
they have been looking forward to receiving these products
this could lead to a bunch of negative reviews on us
i am aware that online reviews are a vital part of successful business nowadays
if customers give us bad reviews our business will be badly affected
can we offer a discount code or something like that
to show them how sorry we are for not being able to fulfill their orders this time
we can certainly do that
how about issuing a five dollar discount coupon per customer
honestly i don't think five dollars is enough to make those customers happy
how about fifteen dollars
that's the max i'm willing to give
sounds fair
do you know how to issue an online discount code
yes iam familiar with it
then go ahead and get those backorders taken care of
yes ma'am
hellho this is public relations company b
hello it's james
oh mm moment please
um anyone help

well we're sorry but we don't have any mr miyagi advertisement section
oh really then is he in another section
i'm sorry but i'm only a translator so i'm not sure may i put you through to the personnel section

right thanks
excuse me kosukisan how can i transfer this line to personnel
oh i'll do it
thank you morisan you saved my life
i want blank when i heard english
it's ok
hey misato did you hear about that
what
the name of our group will be changed again next year
what it was changed only two years ago
i know it will be the new product development group
so they will just add new to the product development group that we have now
looks like it
before that they just switch team in the product development team to group
right
then before that they just took design from the product development and design team
the work we do is the same right
yup just the name change as usual
no change s in our members either
exactly
but we still need to reprint our business cards
and change our group name in the employee database and stuff like that
we need to email our clients about changes again don't we
you're right
i'm sure everyone thinks again what changes now
it is because of the corporate brand imige strategies or something
those things are pretty annoying to people who actually do the work
seriously
and developing new products is not our only job
we do lots of work to improve our current products
i think the name will change again in a couple of years anyway
possible
but i don't need any more business cards that i can't use
i just can't get rid of them
look inside of my drawer
wow
why don't you give them to the shredding service next time
good idea i'll do that when we have the new business cards
such a waste of money for printing and paper
i know cost reduction can start here
as i always feel what the management think is good for the company is a bit different from what we think is good
i know you can't help it with a large company but i just don't want them to change the group names this often
again thank you everyone for joining this press conference for our new product
now i'd like to invite our ceo chifali mensa to join me at the podium and open it up for questions and answers
thank you sanja
hello everyone
my name is jaffalimensa and i am the ceo of company a
i'm please to be able to welcome all of you today
i'm very proud of our new next generation security system
please feel free to ask any questions
you on the front row
please talk into the microphone so everyone can hear you
good morning
my name is curtis tucker and i'm a reporter from f magazine
in the presentation you mentioned spending se years developing this product
in your opinion what was the main challengey
one of our main goals from the beginning was to make it portable so the deployment process would be easy
it was hard to make it small enough while carring and all of the features
since this product carries multiple sensors besides the camera we had to test many different configurations
we also had to make sure the surface was fit for a solar panel
that added another factor but eventually we were able to reach the perfect size we were hoping for
thank you
next question
you on the left
thank you
i'm johanne briant from s times
in your presentation you said this is suitable for schools government offices and shopping malls
do you have plans to make it available for the general public too
we are trying to make a version for household and small businesses
it will be a more athordable model
we are also in the process of testing it to make sure the deployment process is easier for home installment
we are planning on officially releasing it at the end of the year
thank you next
we will start the first period of the safety course how to handle laser products
i am your instructor tanaka
i know you all handle lasers in your daily work and are used to handling lasers
however it is possible you ignore the very basic safety measures when you think you know everything
this class is a refreshere course to remind you how careful you were dealing with lazers for the first time
first can you talk about yourself
i have been working for laser development for <unk> years and i took a safety class as a new employee
i am curious if the safety standards have changed since then
well there have been more accidents in laser experiments so inspections for laser companies have been stricter these days
that's what i thought
i have been with the laser component group for four years
we deal with components and do not handle lasers themselves much so i am wondering if i would learn anything that would be useful for my work in this class
your company owns lots of lazers whether your group directly handles lasers or not so i think it is a good idea for you to know the basic safety measures no matter what your job might be
right you never know when you might go to another group in the company
i don't think you will find this class useless at all
i am here from the personnel department today
i rarely interact with waizers but i would like to learn something that i can use to protect our employees
of course i will talk about the eieexams that is important for laser companies so please pay attention to those topics
okay
everyone is in different areas and is interested in different things
it looks like this class will be fun
for example a class for engineers only would have students with the same interests
then what i do in my class tends to be narrowly focused
that's true what i want to learn and what mr yamamura wants to learn can be very different
so instead of focusing on fewer topics we would be exploring a wider range of topics in this class
i already have the basic knowledge so this will be a good opportunity for me to learn something that i had not even noticed
i might be able to contribute to this class from the position of a component person
let's start then
can you look at the first page of the document i handed out earlier
oh thas looks interesting
the content looks a bit different from when i took a class as a new employee
when ms matsumoto was new here we used to have instructors from a different training center
we've been working with your company since last year
different from when i did it
that makes me more excited
he is a popular instructor
thank you
well let's get to the point now
stacey look at this
what
inside this makoway
yiks what is this
it is so dirty
i think someone warmed a meatsiles posta or twomadea suit and had it exploded
it looks like that but why don't they wipe it off
right
there is always someone who leaves it dirty like this
who would that be
we have lots of people who bring lunches and warm up so we don't know who that is
how about talking to haimai at the facility management and ask him to put a note
yeah like please clean after you make a mess
i thought something like this would just be calm and sense
it doesn't look like it
this gets darty like once every two weeks
some people leave their old food for a long time in the fridge at the lunch room too
so true
you get surprised once in a while when you open it
what if i ask himay to hold a meeting on how to use the lunch room
um i wonder if anyone comes
for now a note will do
then let's see how it goes
well i'll go tell jamy now
okay
but who would clean this now
eah i don't want to but i need to warm up something so i'll whap it off
oh you're good
no it's not like that i just can't stand the miss
oh some people would use it as it is
i can never do that
me neither
uchyamasan
yes
how many registrations do we have from customers attending the ceremony this time so far today
i've only just sent the notice but we already have replies from the companies saying that they will attend
are there people bringing their wife or husband
um there's one couple
it seems mr sugimoto will be bringing his son this year
oh we must bet's the successor to the store
that's nice
i am thinking of talking to mr sato from travel agency c in regards to making the booking soon as flights and also hotels work at full
will it be mr yamada who is coming with his wife
yes
then they wel just need one roomhh
right that was the case last year as well
i wonder that mr sukimoto will be staying together with his son
maybe
i 'll check with both just in case
yes thank you
it might be a bit early to discuss this with mr sato
yeah
we've only talked to the customers attending over the phone and haven't gotten the replies on the invitation yet
it might be better if we wait for a couple more replies from the company's first
yeah let's at least wait until the weekend then do an iditial ccount
i'm back
welcome back
there was a phone call from director sato of a corporation
thank you
did you ask about what he was calling about
it seems he would like an invoice for the goods he received the other day
i hastily prepared one but could you check it
that's a big help
i'll check it right away could you send me the data
alright i'll send it now
suzukisan has a shipping cost been calculated incorrectly
perhaps you calculate it with the figures from the first estimate
oh i'm sorry
i'll fix that right away
thank you
it doesn't seem like there are any other issues so i'll get the sent off to director sato
thank you i'd appreciate if you could do that
it's not thing it was really helpful that you dealt with it
hello thank you for calling c corporation
hi it's tanaka
hi tanakasan it's suzuki
aah perfect
i've just come from a visit to company a but i now have to go to the factory on urgent business so it seems like i will be late back to the office
okay
was there some kind of problem
i've had a request to increase the number of orders from company c so i'm going to speak directly to the factory manager about this matter
oh wow congratulations
thank you
it's all thanks to your cooperation in creating the quotes and documents
what i didn't do anything
if you're heading to the factory now what time are you likely to return
hmm well it will be after <unk> at the earliest
can i ask you to rewrite my return time on the board
alright
take care on your way over there
thank you
our customers have told us that they think our fridge freezer is now a bit bland and oldfashioned looking
so we are looking to update it and make it more stylish
do you have any ideas
well i think we could make the edges and corners more curved to give it a modern look
yes that seems to be the trend nowadays
i think we should add more color options in addition to the standard white or silver
i agree
and it would be good to add some sort of contrasting color somewhere like a stripe
yes maybe one flowing stripe across the entire fridge or one on each compartment
oky so make it more curvy add more color options and add some contrasting color pattern somewhere
i was also thinking to make the digital display much larger and capable of showing more information
what kind of information
well the date and time and i had the idea that customers could set a reminder for when a particular food item will expire
that's a great idea
it may help to cut down on food wastage
any more ideas anyone
that's it from me for now
nothing else for now
well if we could all give this some more thought over the next couple of days and get back to me by the end of the week if you have any more ideas
thank you ms tushiya thank you mr yuchida
thank you very much for your interest in our services
thank you for coming to our office today
not at all
we're just a couple blocks down the street so it was closed
so as you may know we specialize in creating custom reports
right
you guys are able to make market reports for various industries right
not all industries
our focus is on the automotive and chemical industry
in some cases we may collaborate with another company that has the specialization
i see
so just to confirm what industry are you interested in
we're interested in the heavy machinery industry
we're looking for a report that can show the market forecast along with the supplier in demand
i'm assuming this wouldn't be your company specialty
unfortunately not
actually we have a sister company that may be able to handle your request
is that right
yes they're called company a
unlike us they specialize in industry facilities and equipments
so they should be able to have the market intelligence you're looking for
can you introduce me to them
of course
i can send you their contract information later
that would be great
thank you very much
not at all
hi this is calin jones from company a
hi collan
this is sam lee from company b
and with me is ben sherman as well
hello there
thank you for attending the phone conference today
so callen as i mentioned in my email we are currently looking at acquisition opportunities in the automotive parts industry
and i happened to stumble upon your company while i was searching around on the web
i noticed that you guys specialize in m anda support in this industry so i thought it would be a good idea to get in touch with you
wow thank you very much for finding our company
as you may already know our company specializes an mina support for the automotive parts industry
i personally have over <unk><unk> years of experience working for a major automotive parts company and <unk>n years in the investment baking industry
so please tell us about your services
so we offer full support which means identifying potential acquisition targets shortlisting negotiation and closing
the fee structure will consist of a monthly retainer charge and a two percent fee upon the completion of the acquisition
does the <unk> percent apply to the acquisition amount
that's correct
so identifying potential targets would fall within the retainer fee
exactly
how much is the monthly retainer fee
i can put together a proposal in regards to the price and services if you'd like
that would be good
what's the approximate retainer fee though
it is generally around ten thousand dollar a month
is that in us dollars
yes it will be in nust dollars
got it
is there an estimated acquisition amount in mind
we would be looking to acquire a company for around te<unk> million us dollars
okay so a small sized company
that's right
acquiring a large company would cost too much
that's understandable
you o'ld want to buy it a lower price then grow the company
anyways i will send you a proposal within this week
sounds good
thank you very much for your time collin
not at all
thank you for arranging the call sam
we will look forward to hearing from you
i can not believe you are leaving us in three days
i am going to miss this place
i have been working in this office for the last <unk> years
you must have lots of memories here
yes mostly fun memories
but this is the best place i have ever worked at so far
we do have pretty cool bosses and colleagues here
this place will not be the same without you
i am pretty sure my successor will do her job just fine
i heard she has a very impressive resume
i hope you will enjoy your now office just as much as you did here
to be honest with you i am a little bit nervous
it's understandable
it is going to be a big adjustment
the new office has twice as many employees as this one
it seems like a competitive environmente
don't feel discouraged
with your expertise and experience you will be valued
thank you for the encouraging words
i truly enjoyed every minute of working with you
please keep in touch

you will be fine as long as your outfit isn't too revealing or has offensive language
now i feel a little bit better
you know the first day is always nervewracking
ms christy smith is assigned as my mentor
i am so anxious to have her train me
she seems a little up tight
are you talking about christy from human resources department
yes she might not be fond of me
i actually know her from my college days
i know she comes off as stand office sometimes
but she is a very sweet person once you get to know her
she just happens to be a person of few words
that's a relief to know
i just assumed she disliked me
let me tell you about how to let her open up to you
she's a foo die and loves eating out
if you get her to talk about the food she loves she will keep talking for hours
oky i am making a mental note of that
i know many places that offer exquisite cuisines in town
she would absolutely love to hear all about them

how about you bob
i usually get the goat but sometimes do shrimp
i would really like to try goat
i've never eaten goat meat before
i don't like it
do you eat spicy food in japan
oh yes but it's mostly foreign food like indian or korean
our traditional food isn't spicy
what about those spicy tunasushi rolls
aren't those japanese
are you talking about wasabe
no the spicy red sauce that they put on the tuna
i have never heard of that
huh it must be an american thing
they're good
but anyways i am going to call indian restaurant a
please tell me which one each of you want
kinako and i are going to order goa how about sundy and mark
welcome everyone please be seated
i'm tracy with company a
this is my colleague jim
today we're going to show you how your team can use product a to engage with perspective clients as well as your current customers
thanks tracey
if you're like most businesses you track your information using a lot of different tools
funding yor way through email spreadsheets and presentations can take up a lot of valuable time
product a is a centralized tool where you can track everything you need in one place to run your business
how much does it cost
product a is fully customizable so it depends on which set up you choose
ben please let them get through their presentation
tracy jim i apologize please continue
not at all jerry
we encourage questions through the entire presentation
we certainly understand that price is a very important question
i don't want to give you the wrong price so we'll look at a few options later in the meeting
jym can you tell them about organizing accounts
absolutely tracey
product a can organize your contacts accounnt sales deals and documents
where does it keep everything
it runs in the cloud
so all you need is a webbrowser or a mobile device to access everything
wow that's really convenient
i can see how a sales team and management could make use of that
yes it's great for field rips
that way when they traveling they can still have access to all of the information back at the office
tracy tell him how you startd a typical day
the first thing i do is loginto product a and check my home page
at the top of the page are my tabs which quickly help me find all of the information i need
then i write my status update
what's that used for
to let my colleagues know what i'm working on now and cooperate with them
my dash board is where i tracked the business data that is most important to me
you can follow the business information that matters the most to you
what sort of business data do you use the most often
as a business manager i need to track my team's deals to see what stages they're in
can product a do that
absolutely you can see all of your team's deals
you can even set permissions to let them see each other's deals
wow this is really useful
how are the office rent negotiations going
the owner is demanding a <unk><unk>c<unk>nt increase
if he doesn't change his mind we should probably look for a new office
that's not a bad idea
if we were to find a new place we need to consider what is most important
yes if we found a location further away from downtown we could probably get a bigger office for less money
since our company is growing we could use the extra space
that sounds good but we can't be too far out
employees won't want to drive that far each day to come to work
also some of them use public transportation so we shouldn't be too far away from a bus stop
will we need to pay any penalty for breaking the current lease
yes we will need to pay o month's' rent
however that is much less than paying an extra <unk><unk> percent every month for the rest of the year
we need to consider security as well
what is the safest part of town
the west side and east side are both safe
what are the benefits of living on the webside
the real estate prices are lower than the east side
conversely what are the benefits of living on the east side
it is more convenient and closer to downtown
what side of town do you live on
i live on the webside
how about you
yeah me too
i wonder what part of town most of our employees live in
we should take a pole
can you blast an email containing a pole asking what part of town everyone lives in
yeah sure
what do you want the choices to be
let's make them northsouth east and west
then let's start looking at real estate in the area that gets the most votes
although i know it will be less expensive i'm going to miss working downtown
not only is it convenient it's so much fun
if we move out to theside our webside we can't do as many team lunches or happy hours
i hope that doesn't bring down the roo
well we can certainly look at other properties downtown and see if there is one for less than what we are paying now
besides we're just going to collect some data
it never hurts to look
you're absolutely right
if we find some places we like we will have to have a big discussion with all of the managers
hello mr kato
hi mr toyama
i hope i'm not bothering you by coming to your office without emailing you first
it's not a problem at all
did you want to ask me something
yes i haven't been feeling well this morning
i think i may be coming down with a cold
oh no that's terrible
did you start feeling ill this morning
well i woke up late last night and was caughing
i thought i could still come in to work but i started feeling much worse after arriving
would it be okay if i left work early
i understand it isn't easy to work while you are feeling ill
also it would not be good if others in the office got sick
right i really don't want to get everyone sick
so it's okay to go home early today
please get some rest and email me tomorrow to let me know how you're feeling
thank you i'll email you tomorrow
that sounds good
just take care of yourself for now
thank you i hope i can get over this soon
definitely go take a rest
hi mr williams
hello mr taylor
i brought you in to talk about your performance over the past <unk> months
unfortunately it seems like you've been underperforming compared to your coworkers
is everything okay with you
yes everything is fine
however i have been distracted by some personal issues in my life
actually my father is in the hospital with hard issues
this has made it difficult to focus on work lately
i'm sorry to hear that
i hope your father is recovering
thank you
it would be okay if you need to take some time off to be with your family
i'm sympathetic to family concerns
however i need you to come back ready to work
we have many important deadlines next month and i will need you to be focused on work
thank you for your understanding
i think a week off from work would be helpful to clear my mind
no problem
i was going to suggest you to take one week off
i understand
please spend the time with your family and don't think about work
however i will need you to be ready to work hard when you return
sure i understand
thank you
no problem mr williams
also again i hope your father makes a fast recovery
thank you very much
i will touch bass with you when i return to work again
please do

good morning company a how may i help you
hello could i speak to mr jones please
may i ask who is calling
it's joe brown with company b
could i ask the purpose of this call please
yes of course
i met mr jones at the it conference in las vegas last week and he asked for me to call him
he's away from his desk at the moment
when would be a convenient time for me to call back
i'm not really sure mr brown
you might want to try calling back tomorrow morning
or i can take a message and have him call you back
sure so as i said before we met at the it conference and he had asked for me to reach out and schedule a time when i could do an online demonstration of our crm
i'm sorry but you're cutting out
i think our phone lines maybe acting up
can you hear me
yes i can hear you fine
could you please repeat the message
he asked fer me to reach out and schedule time when i could do an online an demonstration for our crm
absolutely mr bron
what is a good number to reach you at
he can call me on my cell it's xxxxxxxxxx
i'll give him the message as soon as i see him
thank you for your help
how can i play this video on the monitor
select input one
then push the big circular button on the remote control
okay now i'm at the home screen
what do i do
push the downcurster and scroll thrugh the applications
then select you too
then search for the video you want to play in the monitor
tv used to be so easy
these smart tvs confused te hech out of me
well now we have so many capabilities that we didn't have before
for example i can record a video and my smart phone and share with the world in real time
yeah it really is amazing what we are capable of these days
<unk><unk> years ago if i wanted to share a video it would have been a lot of work
first i wouldhave had to record it on to video recordeng
then upload it to my computer
it tor that i would have have to burn it to a dbvd
i remember those days
that's when i was in university
i had a computer with a dvdr drive
then sharing it was really difficult
you had to physically mail someone and dbd ware handed to them in person
what do you think or some of the disadvantages of technology being so advanced
people whol expect you to answer call ar tects instantaneously
so now we are always connected
have you ever heard of analog august
no what's that
well for the whole month of august you don't use anything digital
that's impossible
most people probably cheat a little bit
i did it last summer but only in my freetime
that way i can still do my job
however when i was off the 'clock i wouldn't use anything digital
well i am so addicted to my smaltone ad i think i would go crazy
what did you do with all of that extra time
all kind of cool stuff
i took the kids fishing
i grilled a lot of food in the backyard and listened to records
maybe i should try this year
okay let's see what we have today
is everybody here
mr matsumoto can't be here today
he's working on some other stuff and will come here in a couple of hours
well time is thicken let's just start then
what's new this year
we kept the most popular items like candles cookies soaps
new items are all about ecofriendly stuff
santer still strawes tumblers beeswaped wraps bamboo tooth brushes shampoo bars
do you really think people will buy those things as gifts
people started to talk about not using plastic a lot this year
i think that because of the power of social media ecofriendly items are quite trendy at the moment
the new items are not too pricy compared to the other items so people might consider buind them
i guess we have to wait and see the result
don't forget to make the new items stand out from all the other stuff
mr jones how about the order of items
and we move it around or just keep it as it is
i think what you guys did is fine
overall the colors turned out well
maybe we can make it a little bit less shiny
is it only me
shiny paper hurts my eyes to look at
we want people to look at it as much as they can
we will try to fix that problem
when can you bring me the final pamphlet sample then
git should be ready by next wednesday
good i'll see you guys then
i think i had too much food
well it was so delicious
i think i ate more than you
look at my big tummy
let's skip the coffee
i will feel sick if i have coffee now
are you sure
you will get really tired later without your coffee
i will make some tea or something later if i really need it
i just need to walk a bit now
do we have enough time for a short walk
it's quarter to one
i think we can make it back by <unk> o'clock for sure
that's great
let's get some fresh air before we have to go back inside
i want to grab this little piece of candy before we go
do you want one
are you kidding
no
i'm so ful
you never know
it might help
no really
i don't need to eat anything else right now
thank you though
you're very welcome
it helped me actually
let's get going
sure
it's perfect weller for a walk
i love how you enjoy the season everyday
you love it rain or shine
how do you do that
i don't know
i just love whatever we get
as you said rain or shine
don't ask me about it
i hate rainy days
oh i know that
thank goodness it's not raining right now
excuse me
can you help me
sure are you looking for something special
i think i found what i want but there's no prose tag on this
let me have a look
did you get this from the clearence section
i checked the clearance section first but no luck there
alright let me go and grab my machine so i can check the price for you
or is it oky if i just take it with me and come back
whatever suits you is fine by me
i will wait
i can look around more while i am waiting
i will be right back
thanks
hi there thanks for waiting
so this is actually from the clarent section
somehow the price tagg fell off i guess
oh good news for me
how much is it
the original price is <unk><unk> dollars but you can get <unk><unk> ercent off
that will be <unk><unk> dollars plus tex
great
i will definitely take that
is there anything else you need
note i'm good
i guess i will look for the same stuff but in different color
i can do that by myself
thank you so much
you're very welcome
enjoy your shopping
hi this is customer service
how can i help you today
hi i was looking at your website just now
i really want your lady bug costume but i am a little bit confused about the size
we have a couple of lady abouk costumes
which one did you like
it's the one that comes with all the accessories
you mean the one with the hair band mask wings and leggings
yup that's it
i was checking the reviews from other people
some people said it was too small and others said it was too big
so i just wanted to doublecheck before i order it
yeah everybody's different so it can be tricky
of course
how old is your child
she's <unk>
i think she's quite skinny for her age though
well if that's the case i will suggest getting the small size
will that work you think
small is usually good for children up to <unk> years old
this costume is a pretty tight fit but it should work if she is skinning
if you get the meetium the leggings will be too long
hmm okay
i'm glad i checked with you
i'm glad that helped
just so you know the item you wantto order is almost out of stock
oh i'd better order it soon then
there aren't many days left until halloween
thanks for your advice
you're very welcome
is there anything else that i can help you with
nope i'm good
have a great leak
thank you for calling
have a wonderful week
okay so let's get started
anybody would like to report anything first
okay i would like to start with branch b sales report
our sales thist year until thirty november is <unk><unk> million us dollars
unfortunately it's dropped by around <unk><unk> percent compared to last year' sales
and that branche's profit also dropped along with the sales
the reason is because we lost one of our big clients
well that's too bad
you have to find a way to recover
yes of course
i will find a way to seek new client the business pipeline
okay any other who want to report
okay i would like to report about the development progress of our mobile application
our mobile application can now be downloaded from the google play store or ap store
since this application is still new and i think it needs much improvement i would like everyone here to download it and give feedback
before we launch this mobile application to the public and broadcast the information to all of our clients i'd like to receive feedback from our employees first
okay it's great to know that finally our mobile application can be used
please broadcast the information to all of our employees and push them to use the mobile application and give feedback
it will be good if we can launch this application before the end of the year
oky i will broadcast the information after this meeting
okay
guys i'm not really happy with our current supplier of machine parts can you recommend anyone else
why what's wrong with a current one
i feel the quality has dropped a lot recently and we're often made to wait on orders
i agree
what do you think has changed
they've expanded into such a large operation they can no longer cater to the request of small companies like ours
exactly though we' require high precision parts we only need them in a small volume each time so i feel bigger orders are given priority over us
yes i think they squeeze us in between bigger orders and they don't have time to set up the machines properly
leading to less precision and delays i see
there is one place i read about recently that could be promising
where's that
they're called p machining and they sound pretty innovative
i think i've heard of them they use a lot of automation right
yes and they specialize in manufacturing low volume high quality parts with quick turn around times
plus they have a web interface so you can upload your cad file and get an instant quote
you can also tract the production and shipping of parts online
that all sounds great
i'm intrigued but i guess i'm a bit oldfashioned
i'd prefer to visit them in person and check out their equipment before making an order through a faceless computer screen
well i'll see if i can find that article i read
it had their contact details on so i can look about setting that up
thanks christian
can i ask you for a favor
sure
i'm going to brazil next week for a business trip
but i'm actually not familiar with brazil
do you think you can gather some materials on brazil
what kind of material are you looking for
well the business partner in brazil is in the forest industry so information on that would be great
ok so the forest industry in brazil
do you want information like number of sawmills and harvest data
can you also find out what their logging regulations are as well
i think so
what's the purpose of your meeting again
i'm going to see if we should invest in their sawmill
they produce lumber for the chinese and european market
i guess i should also look up where the port is and the trade data
that would be great
i can probably find the trade data from brazil's government website
great
how long do you think it w'll take
i think i can get it done by the time you leave for your business trip
ok that's fine
i can read it on the plane
it's going to be a long flight
i have to transfer once in houston
good luck on your trip
you want me to take on more responsibility
oh no you are not thinking
yes i think you are perfect for the position
i'm not just talking about multinational team ut talking about the entire sales group
this may be a good opportunity to restructure the sales group
so although i was initially thinking just team leaders and abolishing group manager maybe we should have an experienced group manager after all so team leader position could be given to more recent hires
so you mean you want me to fill mari's position
you basically take over her entire package
pay benefits the whole nin yards so to speak
i'm flattered that you use american colloquialism but don't you think eugina is more of an appropriate choice
just hire someone new for global relations and eugina can manage sales
i mean she has an mba from an iv league and at least a decade of management experience
first and foremost she doesn't want any more responsibilities
she has made that clear
you know our family situation right
yeah she told me she has a special needs son
sure he wants to focus on a family right now
that's why she doesn't work full time
second of all it's about time you're rewarded for your work
you know i'm a college dropout
you mention that often
yeah i don't even know how i ended up being hired
i'm finding out everyone else here is an ivy leaguer
mari john eugina taikai jan bin yumi all of our scientists not to manage our management and kate
jesus she was harvardsuma kum lad
not so i went to cambridge
can you just not reb it in
kako loves people who graduate high caliber schools
she thinks it's an indication of something
to me it's an indication of nothing
all i care about is results
you have built up the small cap group all by yourself
you have enough experience
keiko is going to block it
giko thinks highly of you and this one is my decision
all i have to do is have sylvester's approval and i'm confident i can get this through
so are you in
i am very honored to be here
the pleasure is all mine
i have read some of your papers you have submitted with your resume
it was very impressive
thank you very much
so you have had your own company for a while
yes mr ko
although i think company is an overstatement
it was a oneman operation
i was basically just making one lens after another on submitting patents
your resume is very interesting
you received your phd <unk>it years after you set up your own company
yes well engineers don't tend to go for phd's
we are content with a master's
but i did a lot of work with universities and i was close with one doctoral advisor
he advised me i might as well do a phd since the work i was doing was equivalent to what i would do in a phd program
basically all i had to do wasd submit a dissertation and defend it
how many patents do you have
about hundred and ten
that is a lot
that's really impressive
how have you monetized that
well that's the problem
i had about <unk><unk><unk> patents so far but i had to sell nearly half of them
at the end of the day len's alone won't get me anywhere unfortunately
it's always used with something else and if that something else is made by a large corporation they basically take a ventage of the fact that they have more power
they know i need their business more than they need me
so they force you to sell your patent
it's not at a cheap price or not interested
are you compensated well enough in any way for your discovery
from my point of view no
and that is why i've decided that just doing this myself is fruitless
it's better to work with others to create something bigger
but i don't want to be a carg in a big corporation
i wanted to work somewhere that well appreciate my specialty and will able to utilize to the full extent what i make
i think you have come to the right place
do we have any policy on working from home
like tele commuting
yeah
i think the snow is going to be pretty bad next week so i was wondering if i can work from home if i'm snowed in
good point
you have a company laptop and phone so you can technically work from home
i think i will be more productive too
i'm the type that feels more comfortable working at home
i think we're all that tight
let me go check with the administration department on the company policy
i know we usually don't allow working from home on normal conditions
but it can't be helped if you're snowed in
great thank you
let me know what they say
yeah i will
alright guys we only have <unk><unk> minutes scheduled for today
let's try our best to finish up early
it will be fairly quick i think
did you guys already talk about it
yeah we'v talked about it briefly
that will make things easier
as you know this year we will take a longer trip
please let me know who can't make it from each team as soon as possible
nobody likes last minute changes if it's about a trip
is this company trip mandatory for everyone
not really
but of course it will be kind of an important trip for newcomers
lots of other teams say they want to try somewhere totally new this time
i know it sounds great but if we do decide to go to somewhere new someone has to prepare a lot before we go
we neared it down to asia right
yes we just have to decide on which country we want to visit
how about combining two countries this time
will that be too much do you think
we have <unk><unk> days this time so if the countries are close enough it's possible
i think china an korea might work
or japan in china
personally i would love to go to thailand if we can
if we want to try two countries this time thailan might be a bit tricky
are we visiting some of our branches during this trip
well i might have to but not you guys
don't worry about that part
that's good to know though
japan in korea or thaylend and vietnam work for sure
let's put that plan to a vote
make sure that we take other suggestions too just in case
ok that sounds great
i can send out the voting forms for our company app today
oh that will be very helpful
once we decide we will talk about all the details later this month
sure during our lunch time
sounds perfect
yup i think we'reready to go
hello there my name is henry clements from company a
i wanted to reach out because we've been helping staffing agencies like yours find exceptional candidates
i had a look through your job postings and thought we can maybe collaborate in sharing our candidate pool
what kind of idea do you have in mind
well since your agency focuses a lot on the it sector i was thinking of poulling our candidates together to find suitable candidates for more job posts
how would we share the profits
say if we filled your job post with someone in our pool we would get <unk><unk> percent at the commission and you get <unk><unk> percent
and vice versa
sorry iam not too familiar with your agency
our agency is actually similar to yours
we focus on the it sector as well and some of our clients are company b and company c
we've also been working with company d for over t<unk><unk> years
oh is that right
yes so i am certain that our pool of candidates would suit your needs
where are you guys located
we're just a couple of blocks from your office
oh really
maybe we should have a facetoface meeting to discuss this
yes that would be good
when would be a good time for you
how does this friday sound
maybe around <unk> o'clock
yes that sounds great
i will look forward to meeting you on friday then
have a good one then
bye now
hi john are you still available for our meeting today
of course i booked the meeting room number five from <unk>
ah great thanks
we still got about <unk>e<unk> minutes but the room looks available
shall we stat early
i mean only if you are oky with that
sure
okay great i will grab the file
here it is let's go
super
ok so first things first are you having a good time working here
is there anything that's concerning you
oh no everything is going very well
i really appreciate the support everyone has been giving me
it's only been a month since i started working the department but i feel very welcomed and valued
it's great
ah good to hear that
okay so i had a look at your feedback sheet and you have mentioned that there were some times that you had to manage some difficult situation
can i ask you about it
ah yes there were some issues with the production line and i was communicating with the factory
the manager there was quite frustrated with the situation and i felt a little overwhelmed
especially because i still have a lot to learn about our products i feel like i made the situation more complex than it needed to be
but julia was there for me whenever i needed to ask her about things so that was a great help
i see
it does take a little while to get used to it but i am pretty sure you will get there quite quickly
thank you
in the previous department i was just dealing with the numbers so everything is new to me but i am enjoying it
good to hear
it takes a lot of courage to change your career path but i am happy that you are enjoying the new environment
thank you that's very kind of you
product development has always been my dream so i was over the moon when i could grab this chance
yeah mike told me
he is very happy with your work by the way
as an hr it's always great to hear from people working hapfily together
that's the best thing for our company to grow and stay healthy
i agree
ok is there anything else yo would like to talk to me about
no i'm okay
alright wile call me email me talk to me anytime if you need anything oky
thank you i will
it seems that everybody is here let's begin this manager meeting
first of all i need the administration to tell us what's new and what's known
yes i would like to start with new year's greeting cards which should be made by the end of the year
as usual we will put down our company's address as the sender
the up for i will need each person to check if the addresses were correct
we will send the cards based on our client database on the intranet
the company addresses the names and the title should be checked to make sure there is no mistake
you know the client database gets updated each time
we need to pay extra attention since we get quite a few cards back every year with unknown addresses
then does each person need to check to see if the client data is correctly updated
yes as i mentioned earlier i need the company addresses the departners the titles and the names
since it's only once a year this woild be a good opportunity to check everything
also mark unnecessary for those who do not wish to receive the cards even though they are in the database
when do you need them done
by <unk>pm on friday january first since i need to confirm the numbers we need at the same time
does each person decide who to send the card or not to
i am oky letting each department make it's own decision
i am going to go with the data i will have at the time of the deadline
are we getting the printing company to do all the address printing and the shipping
that's correct
we won't see the cards ourselves even though i want to personally write down a message right
yes but i can give you the ones with blank address if you wish you put down addresses yourself
in that case you need to mark unnecessary for those companies in the database
and then send me an email to let me know how many you will need
when do i receive the cards with blank addresses
according to the schedule they should be delivered by december fifteenth
i got it
any more questions
i will be able to assist you as much as i can if you contact me personally so please feel free to do so
is that everything from the administration
yes
should we plan a welcome party for the new employee soon
it has been two weeks since they have been assigned
do you want to schedule it the week after next
sounds good we'll check everybody's schedule later
we need to discuss where we are going to have it
since it's a weekend we will probably end up going to a couple of more places for after party
everybody seems heavywaight as usual
then should we go to the same izakaya as always
we could try something else for a change
what kind of food should we choose
how about chinese
we could bonit much easier if everybody sits facing one another at around table
chinese food it's a little heavy
we are mostly young employees
i'll probably enjoy appertisers over shoshingwan
takadasan do you have any recommendation for chinese food
how about the chinese restaurant in the basement of r hotel
i will make a reservation once i get a head count
that place is close by and has a bar on the top floor we can go for after party
if everybody gets wasted we could just let them spend the night there instead of forcing them to go home
there will be cabs waiting even if we miss the last train
how much should each person pay
of course the new employees pay nothing
the higher the title the price should go up for the rest of the employees
once the number is confirmed i will discuss the course menu with the restaurant
i am going to go ahead and decide on the price as well
i hope it will be reasonable for the general employees
i will probably set the price for about <unk><unk><unk><unk> yens for the non managerial employees
managers might want to brace themselves though
don't you worry i will personally talk to the managers about it
by the way how do you normally pay for the after party
not everybody knows this but everybody above managerial position's place rock papercisors and whoever loses pays the full amount
oh wow ih've never heard about it
for your information it was me who paid for the after party last month
i did not know that thank you so much for that
this is isano
this is nakada from executive assistance office
would you come to the president's office
yes i'll be there right away
excuse me this is a sino from business development department
mr ashino sorry for calling you to come in such a short note
this is about you relocating to oversea which we been talking about
yes
we are assigning you to go to los angeles as of may first
los angeles
thank you
i know you wanted to go to san francisco but i wanted you to research opportunity to extend our business in los angeles
i'm grateful to go to california that i admire
your term will be at least t<unk> years and it will be extended depending on circumstances
what are you going to do about your family
yes my child is still in kindergarten and my wife has an experienced studying overseas so i would like to relocate with my family

your viso will be l <unk>
yes i am aware
you will go there first then your family will go to us afterward
your first year resident will be determined by our law angelos office but you may move to a place that you find on the second year as long as it is within our budget
yes i understand
i will ask mr tanayama from las angeles office to take care of you until you find your way around
i have heard about mr tanuma
although he was born in the us his japanese is perfect and he is excellent all around
that's what i heard

i agree
you have to think about your child's skindegarten
i will have my wife research oemat
you will be busy preparing for to move please take care
yes working overseas is what i've been wanting to do so i will be fine
i have been mentally preparing for this
glad to hear
i am counting on you
you are the key to expand our company business overseas
i feel humble
i will do my best
why don't we have dinner together before you move
okay shall we go right into it
yes i'd like to show our company's new product today
this is the highspec camera
please take a look
what's the difference from the previous model
first of all there are more functions
however the number one feature of this product is this compact size
it took two years to develop this
this small size is indeed impressive
is it selling well
of course
it is our company's popular product
i see
our company's product is well received for its good quality and reasonable price
is that right
i wanted to talk about the price that you are proposing
yes the camera's unit price is <unk><unk> thousand yen
is there a discount for purchasing in large lots
yes we can provide a ive percent discount for buying one hun<unk> of them
can you lower the price a bit more
unfortunately that will be a bit difficult
this is the best price our company can offer
i see
i'd like to compare the price with other suppliers and i'll get back to you accordingly
okay
please do consider us
chomaisan do you have a moment
what's wrong
we will be newly implementing company a's system next time
i thought of asking them to use our existing contract so i showed them our template
but there were sections pointed out by their legal counsel
they asked to change some of the language but what should we do
what exactly was it
it's as this document shows
it seems they are also dealing with their legal counsel through the legal department
they told us to execute the contract directly with the legal department
okay
then can you send me this document in the contact information of the person in charge at the legal department by email
okay
i will consult with our legal counsul
afterwards i will contact the person in charge of legal affairs on their side and figure out the contract
thank you very much
what's the deadline in executing the contract
their request is february first which is when the new system will be implemented
so we still have <unk> months
yes but the actual implementation work will have to start from next month otherwise we won't make it in time
i'd like to get the contract related matters out of the way by the time we start the work
okay i'll talk to our legal counsel right away
okay i will send you the document by email once i get back to my seat
okay thank you
hello this is metropolitan police department c police station
thank you as always my name is takada from company i
sorry but can you transfer me to the organized crime department
yes please hold
thank you for holding this is the organized crime department
thank you as always my name is takada and i'm in charge of running the general meeting of shareholders for company i
yes hello
we have decided the date and time for our company's general meeting wof shareholders and would like to ask you for your presence there
thus i'd like to drop by once with the application for the request
oh is that right
around when will you becoming
i'd like to come at a time that works with your side
we're not too busy with cases right now so anytime is fine
then can i drop by tomorrow afternoon
when is a good time
how about getting you to come around five o'clock in the afternoon
okay
sorry but who should i look for
oh you can just look for me
my name is tayder and i'm the assistant inspector
so it's mr tata
okay
i takada from company i will go to your place at <unk> o'clock in the afternoon tomorrow
okay i will wait for you
thank you very much for dealing with me despite being busy
bye now
thank you very much for your hard work everyone
we practiced the general meeting according to the scenario but how was it
first of all can we get some feedback from you nosesan
yes good job everyone
i think it went smoothly overall
but i'd like to comment on some things
first of all you guys bow when you come into the hall and bow together just before sitting down
the timing is a bit off during that so everyone should bow at the same time
okay when everyone gets to their position at the bowing before sitting down i will give you guys a wink
the executives will then bow in accordance to that
okay let's do that
next when president arakawa is reading the report topics other executive are looking down which stands out
when president arikawa is speaking please look towards the shareholders as much as possible
ok let's get this right
how was the way i talked and my speed
i have nothing to commentat i think it's just right
oky next is during the questions and answers
i'd like to point out a couple of things here
first of all what did you think about it takadasan
well the executives aside from president arakawa were nervous and looking around hen chosen so please stop that
i think it would be better if we are more confident
also i think it's okay to take notes of the content of the question but i think it looks bad if we do not face the person asking the question at all
i think it would be batter if we looke more towards the people asking the questions as much as possible
i agree with the things pointed out by takadasan
if the impression towards the shareholders asking the questions are negative if there is a possibility of the questions becoming awkward
tadakasan was just asking questions after questions but what would be a smart way to do with a in a situation like that
it is not always the case that there will only be one question from the shareholder asking the question
when answering the questions from the shareholders be sure to recite the questions one by one and review it
and at the end of the answer be sure to add that will be it for my answer and end a question
by ending the question we can hold off ounnecessary statements related to it
i see
how was the answer for the questions and answers
you stayed the truth clearly and i thought it was very good
but as for the business for the future the content was a bit too positive and might give them high expectations which kind of worried me
i understand where president arikawa is coming from but there is a risk in releasing information that is basically close to a commitment
i think it would be good to hold back on that a bit
okay got it
thank you for calling company i this is noda speaking
hope you guys are doing well this is nosse from trust bank m
hope all is well with you too are you calling for mr takada
yes please is he in
just a moment please
this is takada speaking
this is nosse from m trust bank
thank you for your business as always
is this a good time to talk
sure what's going on
just one thing another department of ours wanted me to tell you this
what's that
they want to give you a proposal of conducting questionnairs with your shareholders
our company has a team specifically assigned to work on an area like this
they want to see if you guys are interested in sending the questionnairs along with the notice of shareholder's resolution to conduct a survey on your investor relations
they can propose a new better approach for investor relations based on the summary of the answers
the department in charge will give you the detailed proposal later on but i would like to set up an appointment for that if possible
you have done so much for us how can i say no to your request
of course i would love to hear the proposal
when will be a good time for you
since i have quite a few scheduled outings and guests coming this week sometime after this week will be good
i don't have any outing or appointment scheduled on next tuesday and wednesday afternoons so those days will work for me
okay i will set it up and get back to you by the end of the day
are you going to be at the meeting as well
both the person in charge and i will be there
i gotcha
alright let me know when you decide on the time
yes sir i will get back to you soon
talk to you soon
the customer you were on the phone with earlier is that companyy c
yes it was
i just remembered that i did business with company ic before
oh i did not know that
back then i was told they want to use product a with thin clients overseas
they did not mention anything about overseas this time round
then they must have decided to try it out with the domastic ones first to see how it works
when i was on the phone with them i was asked tof product a works on computers that are located out of the country
so i didn't give too much thought to it and replied that we have english versions
what countries are we talking about here
china korea taiwan indonesia mostly asian countries
we don't really have plans to make other language versions available right
yeah i thought so too and i told them we would not carry chinese and korean versions
i see
i don't think anything was wrong with your reply at this moment
assuming the domestic introduction goes smoothly they might start thinking about using it overseas as well
that's true i try to remember that
but technically it would not work
besides some parts of product a are subject to export restriction
oh i am aware of that
it sounds like product a should be used strictly in japan
yes that's the only option we have
mr cooper do you have any other ideas
once that appeal to japanese people please
okay
do japanese people like gift exchanges
gift exchange are more familiar as we do them from when we are kids
if so then a white elephant might be good
what's a white elephant
i don't understand the meaning at all would you please explain it
basically it is a unique gift exchange
each one of us prepares a unique gift that's about <unk><unk><unk><unk> yen
then we put those in one place without telling who bought it and pick and open a gift one by one
opening a gift must be exciting
that's not all
the second person can either open a new gift or steal a gift from another person
the people who had their gift taken away are unfortunate aren't they
if someone steals the gift you opened you can pick a new one to open or steal another one
that makes sense
we continue doing that until everyone's gifts are decided
does this game ever end
it sounds like it doesn't end if you keep stealing gifts
one gift can be stolen up to <unk> times so that's fine
it's exciting until the end of the game
the price for the gift isn't too expensive and it will not be a burden to everyone
it's oka if you have something you don't need in your house
white elephant also means an unnecessary thing
it is that we should have fun while getting rid of things we don't need
i like this idea
me too
it sounds difficult to do with all <unk><unk> employees so should we do it by a department
if so each department has <unk><unk> people so do you think that is just the right number
that sounds perfect
the rules sound a little bit complicated so should we sum them up on a piece of paper and hand them out
why don't we notify everyone tree weeks before we do the white elephant
let's do that
i think everyone will understand the rules once we start playing the game
right
i never thought i could do a white elephant at a japanese company
i'm getting excited
i'll wear an ugly sweater on that day
i will too then
ms sakita do you have a minute
sure what is it
don't tell me that you are quitting the company
no that's not right
actually i wanted to inform you that i am getting married next spring
what
really
that was sudden but was it a shotgun marriage
no i'm not pregnant
i see that's good
pardon me
i thought we are losing another employee
i was thinking to continue working even after getting married
but you will be quitting right after you get a child right
ms urata has quit only th<unk> months ago
i'm teaching so much but i lose motivation if my employees keep quitting their jobs like this
even if i teach with a passion most of them quit their job after three years
in ms uraite's case her husband had a transfer so there was no other way right
it's the same thing
i am hoping to keep working as long as i can
someday when they have a child that would like to take advantage of maternity leave and child care leave
i see
bol t my parents were working so i'm thinking to do the same
if so then that's fine
but anyways congratulations
thank you
good morning muratasan
good morning kobayashisan
thank you for the meeting the other day
did you come up with a plan on expanding abroad
mm i've been thinking but it's not easy
i know right
we've never exported abroad before so i don't know where to start thinking about it
i know
i am thinking of setting a target on a goal first but i can't quite make up my mind
same with me
we are to think of a plan for the trial exsport this time but i haven't been able to decide if we should target japanese people or the locals
the plan will be completely different based on that
i thought of targeting locals but there are so many things to think about that i don't know what to do
we're not an official department yet so we don't have a budget to conduct a field survey
i know
i think for a trial it might be better if we target japanese people as komaiasan said
let's go with that maybe i'll discuss this with satosan
yeah i'll think about it a bit more but that may be the safest bit
this is a company
yes hello this is yamamoto
i decided to call you after seeing your company's website
thank you for calling
what can i help you with
i'm interested in one of your b puzzles that i saw on your online shop
however it says on the page that it sold out
when will it be available again
are you inquiring about the b puzzle
i apologize for the inconvenience
the manufacturer no longer produce it so we won't be able to stock up on this item any longer
discontinued huh
i wanted to buy it fom my grandchild because it seemed like an engaging game
i've tried other shops but i couldn't find any
i'm willing to stop by your shop if you have it in stock even if it's a bit far
could you inform me of any
well about that
we actually still have one available here
but the box has been somewhat flattened
we removed it from our stock due to this reason
there should be no problem with what's inside though
we can put this back up on sales if you don't have a problem with the condition of the box
i see
so there shouldn't be a problem with the puzzled pieces inside
that's right
i don't mind
i'm going to throw the box out anyway
all right then
thank you very much for understanding
we'll have it delivered to you with the shipping fee covered
oh you'll have it sent to me
that would be a great help
are you alright with cash on delivery as a method of payment
yes
if you have a fax machine i can send you the order invoice with the price included
okay i'll give you my number
my number is xxxx xx xxxx
i'll send the invoice to you as soon as possible
okay i'll be waiting for it
sure thing
is everybody here
yes we have everyone now
shall we start then
today we are talking about introducing company electric vehicles
our company cars are getting old by now
how many evs are we planning to buy
initially two cars
as you know the petrol has been going up
we don't have to worry about the petrol if we have the evs
electric cars are ecofriendly as they have no emissions
yeah that's true but
i'm afraid the electric bill would go up enormously
definitely
however the petrol costs will be reduced as well
in addition we may receive a credit from the company for the efficiency
so i guess we can offset the electric bill for the time being
that sounds good
we can find electric car battery charge stations in various places these days
i was thinking i should give it a go
v's have more advantages for the fuel efficiency
for instance
you can use an hv elaine on a motorway
so you can avoid the jam during the busy rush hours in the morning and evening right
that would be great
absolutely
our customer k motor factori says they will give us a discount if we purchase more than <unk> evs
so i guess we've agreed to introduce electric vehicles for the sake of our company as well as the environment
i'll look forward to trying it
so do i
there's another company drinking party this friday
again
we just had one last week
last week was a farewell party and it is the yearend party this time
why do japanese companies have so many drinking parties
it's really a hassle to have your time committed to the company even after work hours
i know right
it's been tree years since i started working at the japan branch but i'm getting fed up with it
it was fun in the beginning though
i am scared when i have to tell my wife about the drinking party
you know that my wife is pregnant right
oh has the morning sickness settled down
no not yet
and i have to look after my two year old boy who's rambuncchus
she was pretty irritated about the drinking party last week too
i don't blame her
honestly she is saying she wants to go back to thise states
she doesn't want to go through all this and be in japan
when we were back in the states i go home right after work and enjoyed family time
but we've been fighting all the time since coming to japan
they say drinking parties in japan is free to join yet there is an unwritten rule that you're forced to attend
it's so stupid
they say it's casual yet we have to always be attentive to the superiors
it's not like we get paid for this too
yeir they collect money for the drinking fee
i can't understand the system in japan at all
gary i don't think you have to attend this week
you should first consult with yamamichisan
i will let him know about your situation with your wife too
that would be helpful
doesn't your wife say anything
my wife is japanese so she's used to these kind of things
she's actually not too fond of it though
she's given up and just says it can't be helped if it's work
i don't know if that's a good thing or bad thing
her dad was like that too
is that right
should i introduce my wife to your wife next time
i think she will feel better if she has a friend she can rant too
yes please
hello
this is awama from the hr department
i would like to talk about employment can you give me a moment
do you have anything in particular you would like candidates to be able to do
let's see
i understand you will be asking about academic background and job history
however i think we need someone who is able to go on business trips as required for the position
you are right
frequent international and domestic business trips are part of the job requirement
so please dont invite them to have a second interview if they are not interested in those
alright
thank you
by the way i will be out of the office next monday
therefore please avoid that date when scheduling interviews
i understand
thank you
no problem byget
company g sent us the payment records for this year by registered mail
what with registered mail
right
regular mail would hav been fine
i recall receiving it by regular mail before
did we receive any other payment records from other companies yet
no not yet
the one from company g was the first for me this year too
did the law change without s knowing about it
like having to send it by registered mail
maybe
the president there is super busy and overthinks a lot
he might have thought that it had to be registered mail and told the administration person to do it that way
the veteran left and a new person started in the fall
the person who sends the payment records is new too
maybe
well it's better than having it lost even though you sent it and having to resend it
yeah that's true
but when i got the delivery notice of delivery records in the mailbox i was surprised as i didn' know what it was
the company didn't contact you that they sent it
no there was nothing
it's not a big deal though
if they give me a heads up then there was no need for me to be surprised
i guess the person is new so they aren't that thoughtful
saetasan thank you very much for taking the trouble to make time for me today
what's wrong you specified a cafe outside instead of at the office
ere must be something serious if you don't want others to hear about it
i actually plan on getting married in december
is that right congratulations
i was thinking of asking you to attend
of course of course i will attend
also i have another thing to tell you
i am actually pregnant as well
well that's double the congratulations
when is it due
i'm due next june and i'm in my second month
i thought i should let you know as soon as possible but sorry for the delay
i didn't notice at all and i learned about it after the checkup at the guynacolegist the other day
you don't have to worry about that
so what do you plan to do about work
do you want to take maternity leave and come back or just quit your job
i discuss this with my husband too but i'd like to come back if possible
the work and workplace is really enjoyable
so you will come back that's great
the senior managing director knows you're doing good work so please do come back
i'm moderd
since that's decided you don't have to do any work that you do now that uses your body
your health is the most important so authers can do these
thank you very much
you 'll need to apply for maternity leave too
if you're do in june then you will take maternaty leave from april
yes it would be great if i can take my lead from around that time
when would you like to come back to work after you give birth
i am thinking of returning half a year later around december
but doing full time like now might be a bit hard
if possible i'd like to use flex time
oh the one nogami sam who is your senior is doing right
i think she leaves one hour earlier than usual so at <unk> o'clock right
yes i 'd like to have my work hours like that as well
okay i will talk to the management
thank you very much
if it gets too tough before you get burk don't push yourself then you can leave earlier or come later too
anyway take care of your body
again thank you very much
sudosan can i talk to you about the result of the checcup you took last time
yes how was it
thate was an issue since an industrial doctor was called right
unfortunately yes
your blood pressure at its piak is <unk><unk> and is on the high side is there anything that you feel uncomfortable
i felt a bit tired after climbing stairs but nothing in particular sad from that
the standard figure for e mail is <unk> <unk><unk> so there is a need to make this number better
okay sorry
and their adominale circumference is over <unk><unk>d centimeters
basically you're overweight
yes i did realizze that my stummach was popping out
the reason for being overwaigh is related to your lifestyle
in other words it can be fixed if you change a lifestyle
i would like to give you instructions on this
my kas are still young so i need to stay healthy so thank you for your help
first of all can you tell me what you eat
i sleep until i really need to leave so there are a lot of times when i don't eat
ou goal visit clients a lot so i eat out a lot for lunch
what do you usually eat when you eat out
i lack noodles so i go to romance thrours offin
do you only eat ramen
just raman isn't satisfying enough so i also leat yasa or fried ross
for dinner i usually have a drink after visiting clients before going home
what do you usually order with your drink
i've never really put a lot of thought on it
usually deep fried stuff lack carage ind kushikatsu
and after i drink i will eat okazuke or rice when i get home
i drink beer again at home and i fall asleep before you know it
i know it's not good for me but it just happens
i don't want to sound so harsh but if you keep this lifestyle up your body might fail on you in <unk>e years
that's not good
tard the change right now but let's start changing things slowly
first make sure you eat breakfast
currently you don't eat breakfast so you eat a lot during lunch
instead of ordering single items for lunch please make it into a set meal and make an effort to eat a more balanced meal
for the evening limit yourself to going to two bos two times a week and try to eat at home
instead of ordering orderly deepfried snacks at the bar ordering things like etinami and chiltofu would be good
sleeping right away is not good so let's hold off on the ochazuki
how about we start but controlling what you eat first rather than focusing on exercising
okay i'll try it since i want to live long
takadasan can i ask your opinion about something
what
at next week's meeting about the preparations for the shareholder's general meeting i'd like to select the gift that we will give out in the general meeting
i'm thinking of presenting several potential gifts but do you have any good ideas
what's the budget
i think about a thousand yen per attending shareholder should be about right
there were about <unk> h<unk><unk> attendees last year weren't there
yes a hundred and <unk><unk> people attended last year
we prepared <unk><unk><unk> gift sets last year at a price of <unk><unk><unk><unk><unk> yen per person
what were last year's gifts again fiv hundr<unk>d yen gift voucher and some confections
yes the confections were steamed buns that had the company logo printed on them
and how were they received
not badly at all the only issue was that they had a short expiration date
we shared the leftover buns amongst people on the company but there wasn't a general feeling that we would do them again the next year
what do you think would be goodww
well due to the profit warning this quarter plenty of shareholders have spoken quite harsh words to me over the phone
since there could be a bad atmosphere at this year's general meeting of shareholders i was thinking something to calm emotions would be good
wow that's pretty abstract
can you not think of anything specific
something like doubshaped shortbread might be nice
why
well a dove is a symbol of piece isn't it
when i have to appear at a meeting i think is going to be rough or a financial results briefing i always make the effort to wear a scarf with a pattern of doves on it
i mean i guess it's kind of a superstition
plus everybody likes bake goods and above all they have long expiration dates
i didn't think you were so superstitious
it doesn't really matter what it is but sometimes you just want something to cling to
that sounds tragic
after hearing your story i have also come round to the idea of doubeshaped confectionary
i will present it as one of the potential choices
thanks
kawakamisan your company has a very impressive conference room
i wish you could work at an office like that
speaking of an office i know our company is looking for a new location
is that true there is a vacant space on the second floor
since you are already here would you like to take a tour
i think the management happens to be on the second floor right now
i guess i can tour or take a tour since you offered
kawakamisan please take us there
wat there is nothing not even a partition
it's just an open flor with nothing
this is mr kawada from our tenant managing department
nice to meet you i'm kawada
i am igami from s training company great to meet you
i am yamada also from s trading company pleasure to meet you
let's get to the point this empty area could be divided and turned into your ideal office spase
if they use floorda sealing partitions it could be divided just like rooms
i see yamadasan did your floor use to look like this too
yes it was
we will divide the area according to our client's' wish
pesitions aren't quite the same as walls well i hear noises through the of them
it would become an issue if other employees could overhear meetings that discuss sensitive subjects
don't worry you will have nothing to worry about
we could easily solve this with soundproof partitions
the soundproof ability will even become much higher if you choose double glass partitions
we could also use a noise masking system to solve this problem
the system admits a soft inconspicuous bracklare and sound two prevent noise leaks
it seems like there is a variety to choose from
also there is usually a gap between the door and the floor and you could also fill this gap to keep the noises from leaking
looks like we will not have any issues with all these possible solutions
our company stores some classified documents and is there anything security system we could install
you have no thing to worry
you could itstall blinds inside to gift the rooms m privacy
of course the security system could be installed in the room as well
what do you mean
this very room you just entered normally has a security system at the door
in order to keep outsiders from entering the security card is required to open the door
additionally a selected view could be given the authority to enter the room
does it mean other employees aren't permitted to come in the room even if they want to
yes exactly
there is a vacancy on the <unk>th floor and we could go check it out if you want
ah what should i do next
oh i thought you were done for the day kento
well i just have my current contract on my mind
your contract will end at the end of next year right
yes the current project will be over in one year so i should figure out what to do next before another longterm project starts
uh  that's the thing about researchers usually with fixed term contracts
my grant for scientific research will be expired soon too
isn't there anything that could be done about that five year term for kakanhi fund since most of the projects runs for te<unk> years or longer
well that's all up to the great mex to decide you know
but we're lucky the c national institute has connections to places like mic so we can work in a pretty good environment
there aren't many labs with sufficient budgets so it would be pretty harsh if you could accidentally choose one of those places that can't raise funds
that reminds me of a huge project in singapore that was deadlocked because of lack of funds a while ago
see oh i might be wrong but are you looking at laboratories abroad as well
well i should keep my options open right
i'm a kind of guy i'd like to stay in japan and i don't want to get farther from kakubungi station
hahaha just because it's easier to submit applications isn't it yo
but seriously laboratories in japan are not bad like the one in k university which is doing pretty well with patents
that's true but at the moment it's a rare case within the country that university industryresearch collaboration is working out like that
after all my choice out of labs in universities would be cm university or uc university in the us i guess
if you' thinking of going to the states a friend of mine from collegies at c institute of technology now and says it's pretty comfortable with bunch of asian people
he also says quite a few acient researchers are producing results there
uhhuh i believe that institute doesn't support a firmative action so that's probably why there are more agens
you're n excellent researchet an a fluent english speaker i'm sure you'v had no problem moving there
your wife has also studied abroad hasn't she
yeah but it's not only the language matter you have to consider when you move abroad with your family
my whole family have to get used to many things like the workplace school and lifestyle
but moving there alone is not your option right
of course not with a multier contract i cannot leave my family here
if you have hard time getting used to things you might as well find a job in europe like k institute in sweden
hmm k institute probably wouldn't take me with my field of expertise
how about mpinstitute in germany they hare researchers from a wide variety of fields don<unk>t they
ah i was trembling as i went through the annual report the other day
well it's well known that the positions at mp are lowpaid so i wouldn't be able to stay for long you see
wo i'm so jealous that you can actually think of working there
working in germany well it sounds pretty good but still the salary is a hurdle i guess
instead you can build reputation as a researcher
it seems that most people quit after fiv years or so and get highpaid jobs elsewhere
i would love to join them if i was capable enough

hi i have an appointment with mr konno from two
hello
could i have your name please
sure it's wakuu takoko
thank you
konda is expecting your visit in the meeting room
please follow me
thank you
here it is
mr konda mr takakaw has arrived
okay thanks
hi mr takoka thank you for coming
thank you for inviting me
this is a beautiful office
the building itself the entrance is all very big
ahahahaa thank you
did you use that glass elevator
using that as my favorite part of coming here everyday
yes
it was very thrilling i almost felt like i was floating in the air
exactly
all right so as i explained to you in the email i urgently need you to translate this manual as we decided to install another device to the guest room
it's a digital code lock and although how it works is quite simple it can be a bit tricky to get used to it
here is the actual machine
we valued the esthetic a bit too much and can you see
you have to push here to open the cover but it's quite difficult to notice for the first time
umuh
also to make the numbers appear on the screen you need to press the screen
so these two things are potentially confusing to users and i need a good user guide in english so that our guests will not have to spend hours trying to figure out how to unlock the room they're staying in
i understand
however we do not want to stick notes all over it
we need a simple but clear instruction
can i come up with something
can i borrow the manual so that i can fully understand the system
sure there are many so i can give you one
thank you
when do you need this bye
if you could send the idea by friday that would be great
sure i will start working on it
thank you
thank you for your attendance everyone
today i'd like to brainstorm some ideas to increase sales
i was thinking of employing a customer loyalty program
it's been very successful with other companies
how would ours work
i know there are many different ways to do it such as an ap or a stamp card
we would probably use a pointbase system
we'll have customers sign up at the register where we'll give them a card that can be scanned at the register
they'll get points for each smoothy they order
they will also get more points if their order is more expensive
once they wrack up enough points they can get a free cup of smoothy
you could also have special deals for members
maybe on certain days if a customer brings their card they can get <unk><unk> percent off of their smoothy or something like that
that's a great idea
any other ideas
how about instead of the card we do a reusable cup
we can give customers a discount every time they bring in their cup
more people are trying to be environmentally conscious anyway
i think we could sell different designs and even metal straws
if we include our logo it might also provide a bit of advertising for our stores
that also seems like a good idea
i can see the prose and conts to both
perhaps we could integrate the reusable cups into the point system
that could work
we could soll the cups in the store but still have the membership program beyond the card
but if you remember maybe you can get a discount on the cup or get it for free as a rewort
i'll have to think about it a bit more but thank you for the ideas
ms beso can your team prepare a few design ideas for the cup and card by next week's meeting
of course
thank you
we'll finalize our ideas at next week's meetings
