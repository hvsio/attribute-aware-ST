r in order to build our careers', 'we were generally committed to our jobs and the companies we work for', "yup that's what i hade been doing for the last <unk><unk> years", "but the melenniums don't

to go completely paperfree at once', "i think we'll probably have to take baby steps", 'each division should manage their paper usage since they all have different needs for documentation', 'we could probably start by having everyone save new paperwork digitally', 'then someone could convert the old paperwork into digital copies', 'i think it would take a lot of work in the beginning but it might help prevent papers getting misplaced in files', 'that seems like a good idea', "i'll meet with the tech team to see what our options are", "we'll need to evaluate different softwares to see which will work best", 'then we can calculate how much the implementation and training will cost', 'i think we can discuss these details further next meeting', "i'll go ahead and bring in someone from the

i'm done", "i don't check my line very often so i think a text message to my mobile is better", "i don't really like that messages get marked as red and these makes you feel like you have to reply right away", 'oh mr brown always uses line and he sends messages with stickers too', 'no way', 'seriously he does silly things sometimes', "yeah why don't we ask mr brown to join us", 'oh no that is

careful as that something the company is pretty stringent on', 'but still how come our company cafeteria has an annoying rule of only one main dish and two side dishes', "because if we have a buffet

of meat products to increase greatly", 'key products will be beef and pork', 'now aside from the tariffs the deal also brings other benefits among the countries', 'for example this will open up opportunities for other companies in other countries to bid for government contracts', 'typically government contracts can only be bid by the local companies but this will change that', 'and with the reduction or removal of tariffs it will allow foreign companies to be more competitive in bidding for government contracts abroad', 'so the trade deal is not a simple reduction or removal of tariffs but has other features to promote the prosperity of the countries involved', 'i could go on for hours but since we still have a whole day ahead of us i will stop around here', 'so after this we will have a panel session with the trade commissioners from government agency a', 'they will provide their insight on the benefits of the trade deal and explain some of the government programms that

has asked me to design and write it broshure to promote the new service', "i don't want to let him down but with the sales reports due for next week and the trade show to prepare for it's a bit much for me to take on at the moment", 'if you have the time i was hoping you might be able to whip something up', "if i remember correctly weren't you the one who spearheaded that project", 'surely someone so instrumental in its development would do a better job', 'yes but graphic design is not my forta', 'plus i now need to put all my effort into things like the trade show to help get my baby

getting less", 'when should i be pouring it', 'like one third', 'or when the glass is completely empty', "people preferences varies but i'm the type that does it when it is empty", "there isn't really a set amount", 'you will probably know if you try pouring it once when it is around one third', 'people who dislike it will say no and those who are fine will just hand you their glass', "but i don't think you have to be that detailed and attentive just por it when you notice it", 'i see got it', 'should i be pouring alcohol to managers or the section chief', 'i think it would be good to go at

hours", 'alright then we must get in this order', 'do we send them to one of the company approved hospitals', 'that is one option', 'or the company can organize a group health examination or allow

it as working hours', 'okay i will let you know when i prepare the memo for the health exam', 'that would be great thank you', "just because we're new why do we have to take the initiative in picking up calls", "why can't whoever is available pick it up", "that's true", 'but if you take the initiative and pick up it will be a chance for the other party to know that a new person joined and to remember your name', 'and if the way you handled the call was good your reputation will get better from outside and inside the company', "oh that'd be nice", 'so please do pick up the calls', 'then why is it that we have to gather reference materials and pick out information', "isn't this something that the author should do", 'well there are amateur authors and of course professional authors who do it themselves', 'but i want the author to focus on the story in front of them now', 'gathering reference materials does take some time to do', "so i'd rather have the author spend that time writing", 'also gathering materials and picking out the information from a different perspective can bring about a new idea for the author too', "so it's not just simply gathering materials", "i

which sensor are we showing them', "well kintara wanted to put out the lagtest one's but", "we haven't completed testing for the one with vein authentication yet you know", 'weare still developing <unk>dcensors for face recognition too', "so we've decided to show our iris authentication since it're currently mounted on f corporations s phone", "as for our latest sensors it's probably safe tor tomensioni a little at the end of the coverage", 'fu i was worried if something went wrong like that time with e fingerprint sensor', 'i still carry the trama you know', 'oh that was chilling and it was a live show too', "i don't know what you guys are talking about", 'about fingerprint authentication', "oh yeah i was quite a while ago so maybe you weren't around then anna", 'about ten years ago i believe', 'yes like this time a tv show covered our fingerprint recognition sensor which we had just developed at the time', "unfortunately it didn't work out properly during the live report and we couldn't cover for the trouble on the fly either", "yeah the slabs' reputation took a nose dive then and we had to spend few years to recover", 'kantaro insisted that he show the latest product at the time as welle', "unlike this time i couldn't convince him not to", "but i think the big part of it was that toru filled round with the sensor even though he didn't know much about how to use it", "he's the director of this laboratory but just the figurehead a retired official isn't he", 'wo you should watch your mouth ron', "well seriously he always intervenes and projects he doesn't really understand and gets us into troubles", 'past week too toru followed me to see my presentation at f corporation thoughu', 'he just kept telling them unnecessary things so i had to spend so much extra time to follow up with explanations for each and every aspect', 'oh he did that to me too at an exhibition last month', 'he spoke to participants as if he knew everything you know', 'i had to be on the watch and cover for him throughout the event and made me super exhausted', 'he should learn more about our products if he wants to go speak in public', "well everybody calmed down a bit don't be so hard on him", "toru is thinking of how he' do better this time so he should be okay", "wait wait a set what do you mean he'd be okay", "well you ere all talking about it weren't you", "about toru's appearance on tv", "you're not saeing thet toru will be on the show this time with our irotes recognition sensor are you", "yes you didn't know", "nono no that's definitely impossible", 'no way no more of that nightmaire', 'is he trying to tramatize the whole lab now', "hello everyone let's get started with today's meeting", 'my name is okada', 'nice to meet you all', "sone this is our first meeting let's begin with a quick introduction around the table", "then i'm going to give you a brief introduction of our new project", "i'm going to be leading this team for the duration of this project", 'i notally work at unit one in the sales department', 'please come and talk to me at my desk in unit <unk> if you have any questions or suggestions', "it's nice meeting you all today", 'would you like to introduce yourself next ms kishita', 'sure', "nice to meet you all i'm kishida", 'i am at unit two in the sales department', 'i look forward to working with you all', 'nice meeting you too ms kishida', 'my name is miyamoto', 'i work in the sales promotion department', "i'll look forward to collaboring with you both", 'we are now going to talk about the outline of this project', 'the new project aims to identify new users for a payment settlement system', 'furthermore we are also looking at extending our services to new types of users from our list of sales leads', 'what exactly do you mean by new type of users', 'good question it means we are aiming to attrack not only retail shops or restaurants but also any other potential opportunities', 'i see', 'okay', 'we want to get various types of users', "that's right", "that's why our team comprises different sales departments and divisions", 'exactly', 'each department in unit has a different marketing strategy and that would be our strength', 'yes', "let's make this project a success", "yes let's try our best", 'of course we will have a revenue target but we will go into that more in ar next meeting', 'anyway we should close the meeting here as we are running at a time', "i'll email you the schedule for the next meeting and the supplemental documents later", 'yes noted', 'yes please', 'hi kana can i ask you something', 'sure', "there's a student who wants to send his personal belongings to japan by c", "he's leaving the country next month and he came to the office yesterday asking for advice", 'i understand that we usually use company wi for the shipment but when i called them this morning to get a quote they basically told me it would cost more than <unk><unk><unk><unk> pounds', "since that is a way out of his budget i'm trying to find other ways of doing it", 'right', 'company wy offers the service as one whole package and while it is very convenient it tends to be a bit overpriced', 'if we can find a shipping company here and a custom broker in a delivery company in japan separately by ourselves the total fee should be cheaper', 'i see', 'we had a similar case a few years ago', 'i think i can find the reccord here give me a sec', 'thanks', 'here it is', 'we ask company w to collect the cargo and ship to the japanese port in tokyo then for the custom paperwork we ask company e and they arrange the delivery for us as well', 'the total fee was five hundred pounds', 'obviously the feeble change depending on the size and the weight of the cargo as well as the value of the contents', 'we could avoid getting any custom charge for this case so that was good', 'how much stuff is he going to send', 'it should be about the same as hers', "okay well obviously we shouldn't expect it to be exactly the same but i'd say we can do it in the same way this time", 'yeah i will call company w', 'they wold need a rough amount of the package and a value of the content so maybe check with a student first', 'ah yes', 'i will email him', 'oh also company w may have introduced cms so check that with them too', 'what is se amus', "it's contained management searcharge", 'it is a little unclear if that is really a thing but some shipping companies charge the broker when they unload the cargoes at the port', "it's like a handling fee", 'i see', 'company w did not charge us the last time so hopefully it still is the case', 'yeah', 'can i ask you to send me the file of the previous case', 'i want to go through it', 'of course', "actually i'm going to make it anonymous and uploaded on our shared database", 'we may have similar cases in the future', 'thank you', "you're welcome", 'thanks for offering to help me with my presentation', "i've never given a presentation in front of such big audience before", "i'm glad i could help", 'what are you planning', "i'm thinking about using a slide show", "i'll probably include a pye chart showing our demographic", "then i'll use a bar graph to show our numbers for each region", 'i would suggest explaining the graph rather than just showing', 'be sure to point out whach each access means', "that way you cald make sure everyone understands what you're trying to show", 'also i make sure the colors between the sections of the graph stand out easily', "don't make it too fancy though", "it's better to keep it pretty simple", 'okay', 'that makes sense', 'how does is thene look', 'that one is a bit too complicated', "it's hard to read what the labels say", 'i think you should try this one instead', 'thanks', 'do you have any typs for the actual presentation', 'i would say practice a few times before', "space outer practice between a few days so you won't be too stressed by practicing on the last day", "just don't be too nervous and make sure to look around the room rather than at the white board", 'the more you have your presentation memorized the easier it will be to make eye contact with people', "i'll be sure to practicee", "that's the part iu're most worried about", 'thank you for your help', 'no problem', 'good luck']
